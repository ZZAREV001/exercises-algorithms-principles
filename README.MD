Exercises that I realized in 2021 and 2022 with my excellent teachers Patrick and Ryan. Exercises are focused on algorithms, data structures, and finding the best space-time complexity scenario. Some exercises were useful to understand the lowest level of working of machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms without using any frameworks or libraries.

Thanks again to my teachers, Patrick and Ryan.
